One of the best pizzas we have ever had.  Without asking, they included 2 paper plates, paper towel and utensils to eat.  <br />
                    <br />I would recommend this place if you are new to the area, and I am jealous of those who live here! I wish we had this restaurant in East Lansing, MI!  Thanks Pizza Rita for a great meal, you will be hearing from us again :)" - <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114252372643716291250/reviews/" target="_blank">Erica M.</a></blockquote>

                  <blockquote class="text-justify">"Two days ago i was at the downtown location, on my way to work and I talked with a employee that has worked for pizza rita for 15 years or something like that, anyhow she had great things to say bout Bryan, the employees ect, she seemed like she absolutely loved her job, she said the owner takes very good care of his employees, and always treats them with respect, for over 15 min she went on about how much he lives his customers and cares about his employees. . She didn't gave one bad thing to say ... I personally have quit going to business because the way the owner or manger treats three employees, however after hearing of how the owner of pizza rita treats his employees every bussiness should treat there employees like pizza rita employee's Bryan you are awesome business owner!!!" - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/krystal.snellings/posts/10208767932182776:0" target="_blank">Krystal S.</a></blockquote>

Get the 5 pounder with extra cheese, add fresh garlic AND sliced tomatoes! OMG - your taste buds do the happy dance in your mouth! We have been faithful loyal customers for over 15 years!<br />
                    <br />We loved the original store over by NC, then you moved across the street, still loyal, then we moved out to the valley - used to drive in to get your pizzas a couple of times a month. Now I have you deliver to my work so I can bring home the delicious goodness that is the original Pizza Rita's!" - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jazzbug/posts/842111575831314:0" target="_blank">Jasmine J.</a></blockquote>

Pizza Rita workers are always friendly and very nice on the phone or in person. What I love the most about Pizza Rita is that they will take any other pizza places coupons and will match there deal. Also I love the fact that if you order 3 or more pizza's you get 50% off your order.<br />
                    <br />
                    Pizza Rita also has hot and fresh pizza by the slice and they have RC pop too. I can't think of any other pizza place with RC.... If you want a great pizza then please try Pizza Rita the next time you are in the Spokane Washington area." - <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/pizza-rita-spokane-3?hrid=oV2xQCFBOig_m7u2NRdByw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)" target="_blank">Bryce W.</a></blockquote>
